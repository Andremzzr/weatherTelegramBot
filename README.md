To make this project  used Weather Api and an Telegram api

To install the telegram api, set this composer command:<br/> 
`composer require telegram-bot/api`<br/>
Link for the API documentation down bellow:<br/>
https://github.com/TelegramBot/Api


The Weather API that was used is from the website<br/>
``https://openweathermap.org/api``<br/>


I'm trying to learn how to get the Telegram users messages for add more aplications in the Bot. I plan to start adding this in the next few weeks</br>


Now, I'm using a while true loop to use the script like a alarm clock. I put the hour that I wake up, and receive a Good morning message with the climate status.
